# What is MC-8?
MC-8 is a basic Chip-8 Interpreter/Emulator. It can play most roms for the original Chip-8.

# What is Chip-8
Chip-8 was originally an intepreter for the COSMAC VIP kit computer back in 1977. It was made to made to ease game development on that exact system. Now, however, it is used as a way to allow novice emulator developers to make their way into the emulation development space.

# What is the current status of this interpreter?
While this is by far not the most optimized nor fastest out there. This is my very first attempt at a interpreter / emulator.

There are certain bugs I still have to iron out.

Also if you do decide to check the code out, be forewarned that it is messy.

# How do I run this interpreter?

There are two ways to run this interpreter.

Option 1:

1. Download the sketch.js file / Copy the raw code
2. Run it within the [Online P5js Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)

Option 2:

1. Download the most recent source from the Releases.
2. Make sure to install p5.vscode and the Live Server Plugins
3. Open up the folder containing the source in VS Code and run the live server plugin to run the interpreter.
